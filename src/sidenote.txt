However, it's important to note that while React.lazy() can help with the initial load time, 
it doesn't directly reduce the overall bundle size. 
The total size of your application's code remains the same. 
The difference is that the code is split into separate chunks, which are loaded asynchronously when required.
=============================================================================================================

So, to summarize, React.lazy() improves 
the load time by splitting the code into separate chunks and loading them on-demand. 
It doesn't directly reduce the bundle size, 
but it allows for a more optimized initial load experience. 
To reduce the bundle size, you would need to apply additional optimization techniques and tools.
=============================================================================================================

Reducing the bundle size is typically achieved through other optimization techniques such as 
tree shaking, minification, 
compression, and utilizing code splitting strategies beyond React.lazy(). 
These techniques help eliminate dead code, 
remove unused dependencies, and optimize the remaining code for size.
